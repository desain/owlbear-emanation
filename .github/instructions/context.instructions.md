This project is an extension for the Owlbear Rodeo VTT. It uses Vite to bundle and serve assets, React and Material UI for the interface, and Zustand for state management.

When writing code, prefer a functional style with readonly parameters.

Check the README in the #codebase tool for information on how the extension works.
